# NoGRCExperiment

How would the Singaporean Parliament have looked like without Group Representation Constituencies (GRC)s?

## Assumption

The main assumption made in this thought experiment:

- Seats in GRCs would have been split proportionally based on votes. E.g. If a 4-member GRC had a vote split of 75:25, the seats would be split 3:1.
- Results of SMCs remain the same. 

But what if the 4-member GRC had a vote split of 80:20? This is where the scenarios come in.

There are 3 main scenarios:
1. Pro PAP: PAP gets the rounded up seat split. e.g. PAP gets 4 seats in an 80:20 vote split.
2. Anti PAP: PAP gets the rounded down seat split. e.g. PAP gets 3 seats in an 80:20 vote split.
3. Pro Winner: The actual winner gets the rounded up seat split. e.g. If WP actually won the GRC, WP gets the 4 seats and vice versa.
